    <h3>Notes on SLFP</h3>
    <p>
      This is a demo of a save & load fighter platformer for the game Maker's
      Wrath. It features the basics of 2D Platformer combat, with the player and
      the enemy AI shooting projectiles at each other, but with the added twist
      of both the player and enemy being able to save and load game states
      simutaneously in the game. This can allow for interesting strategies, such
      as saving a state where an opponent is cornered, or for saving at a place
      for safety. Loading into such states can give the player an advantage by
      surprising the opponent or being able to counter strategies that have
      taken during that skipped timeframe.
