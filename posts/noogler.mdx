Just joined Google in the Event Threat Detection team! There's a lot of perks Google has to offer, such as:
* Free transit (via shuttle buses)
* Free microkitchens (lots of snacks)
* Free gyms
* Free nap pods
* Free bidets

And this isn't mentioning the high salary and GSUs (Google Stock Units) for compensation.

I can now see why a lot of engineers want to work here now...
