Here are my first impressions starting at Google :)

## Day 1 - Remote Start

Today had 2 important calls. The I-9 call which is just to show some documentation proving my identity and ability to work here, and the credentials setup. This is what my desk looked like before that call:

It's a lot of installing, so I had to move back to the hotel for stronger internet instead of rely on data, but once that was all done, I was able to use my "gMac"!

Yeah, here at Google there are a lot of gThings. From here, I found out a few things:

- You can now contact me via **jangarong@google.com** !
- Google has a lot of internal tools that are substitutes to what large tech companies typically use!
- There is an employees-only merch store in Mountain View (not the one in Gradient Canopy)!

In terms of actual work-related things,
I said hi to the hiring manager who hired me in the team matching call, made my introduction
email to to the team and was also greeted by my new mentor!
Yay! I also finally understand the org structure which is what I predicted before. It's basically:

- Event Threat Detection (where I am) is a part of
- Security Command Center which is a part of
- Google Cloud Security which is a part of
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) which is a part of
- Google which is a part of
- Alphabet

Overall good first day :) I was able to chat with my other friends who joined a few months prior who also matched around the same time as me! Starting tomorrow I will be taking the GBus and see what's inside the Sunnyvale MP6 office!

## Day 2 & 3 - Welcome to SVL MP6

I'll combine these into two days because the 2nd day was cut short due to router setup & banking setup. Nothing notable happened other than not having internet for 6 hours due to hotspot being spotty (thanks GoogleFi) and the previous tenant or internet provider destroying all the fiber cables.

### Google Sunnyvale - Moffet Place

First I got to the office through Google's very own public transit system, the gBus!

And now, here's the office!

  <img src="/assets/b/log/noogler/3.jpg" class="object-cover w-full h-full" />
  <img src="/assets/b/log/noogler/4.jpg" class="object-cover w-full h-full" />
  <img src="/assets/b/log/noogler/5.jpg" class="object-cover w-full h-full" />
  <img src="/assets/b/log/noogler/6.jpg" class="object-cover w-full h-full" />
</div>

Anyways, even just by seeing 1 + 1/8th of the 50+ Google Bay Area buildings, these buildings has so much to offer!
There's free food, free transit, free microkitchens, free gyms, free nap pods, free bidets; you can practically live, eat and sleep
Google 24/7! _maybe this is how they get you to stay and never leave the office haha_

Back to the internal tools, I would say they are very good, and very specialized towards Google!
There's our own version of Google Workspace that we use, plus much much more! Since Google almost
has an equivalent for basically everything, it's like experiencing a "different" version of the
internet, from the search engines to their own social media platforms!

Overal the experience here at Google is very other-worldly!

### But what about what you're actually going to do?

I'm working on a Cloud Security product for sure that's dependant on events (mainly logs) produced by cloud infra (AWS/GCP/Azure)
internal infrastructure (specific to GCP) or other means (K8s/Docker/Google Workspace?!). I've dealt with a similar product
in Trend Micro; whenever I tried to make a virtual machine or any instance with open ports or a deprecated/vulnerable OS Image,
Trend Micro detects it and removes the VM. I see its use case though! Very cool product, but also I have never
dealt with cloud security in depth, so ... good luck to me? I didn't know Blockchain/Email Security either before, so let's hope I can quickly
pick up these concepts fast as well!

Now that I'm here, I can see why so many people want to get into Google...
