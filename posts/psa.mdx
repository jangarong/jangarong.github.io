*Behold, the one thing I've been working on the longest!*

These are my Raspberry Pis that I've been using for self-hosting and learning!

## Penguin Secret Agency

Originally the RPi now known as the "Penguin Secret Agency" (will soon get its own project page)
has been the same RPi used in my Grade 12 Great Roamin Robot (GRR-Pi for short, also will get its
own project page in due time), repurposed to serve many key services I use mostly for file storage 
and archival purposes:
* ArchiveBox (/) - My very own web archive!
* Filebrowser (/files) - Basic file storage.
* Syncthing (/sync) - File sync for backups/redundancy.
* Gitea (/git) - Mirror of my GitHub repositories.

And these services, great combo btw, is what I use to create the VPN for the above services:
* WireGuard or specifically wg-easy - Open source VPN service.
* PiHole - Open Source DNS service with adblocker for the VPN.

Lastly, for secure browsing:
* NGINX - Used as a reverse proxy for the above services.
* certbot - Used to create and renew certs.

### Design Considerations

Outside of the primary 4 services, the VPN and HTTPS setup I used was mainly out of my interest of 
having my very own intranet, kind of like the big corporations that do it. I would also like this 
entire setup to be very offline-friendly or air-gapped compatible, which I have achieved, mostly. 

The only thing I was not able to really "perfect" in my own eyes is the certificate renewal, which 
the only way to make it purely offline or compatible is to host your own certificate authority, 
install a root certificate on all of your devices, it's a lot of work and also I'm unsure if 
this is the correct approach.

Scalability could use some improvement though; maybe if there's some WireGuard + OAuth integration
I can use, or maybe if I use Kubernetes which my RPi could not handle at all. At the end 
of the day though, I'm the only one using it, so I think it's fine as is.

Also, please don't comment on how this is all wired and connected. It's used with whatever USB-C
cables and sockets that I could find xD

## Other Services

You might wonder about the other RPis and the router attached on the side. The plan at 
the end is to make it so that the only way to access the RPis is via this router, with 
the other two RPIs being more experimental Docker containers, thus making it sorta? air gapped.

I still plan on doing this, I've just been flip flopping on it since it's a matter of convenience
(can connect on home router) and bad UX for me (connect to router, connect to VPN).

## Why am I saying all of this?

I've been working on this ever since I've discovered Docker and did DevOps for that one webdev 
course, which was since 2021-2022. I have been needlessly adding and updating and removing 
services, but after evaluating my most common use cases for my self-hosted services, I have 
decided to stop it here.

I'm planning to do a mix of the following in the near future, which is going to be exciting :D
* Foundational Cybersecurity Training (pending)
* Fitness (about time I go to the gym lmao)
* Foundational Drawing Classes (starting next week!)

Until then!
