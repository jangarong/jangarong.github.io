Today was a good day.


I woke up fearing of everything that could go wrong today, or that it was all a dream, but it wasn't.


This isn't a startup like dApp or CertiK, nor is it a unicorn, but neither did it feel
like a slow/legacy kind of company either.

</div>

Compared to other work environments I've been in, Trend feels more open and "new"!
I didn't need to fill in timesheets, nor did I have to use an old laptop to do 
my work. It also wasn't a place that heavily relied on outsourcing too, so the only 
timezones I had to deal with while working was in the East Asia (that's where their HQ 
is) or Canada.


I guess the only negative thing I can say about Kanata North coming from someone who 
has lived in Toronto for the last 2-3 years is the public transit is very slow, and 
everything is spread out. Some advice for people who plan on working here; you will 
need a car. That is non-negotiable!


That is all! Excited to start working here!
