2 days ago, I graduated. Was it worth it?

## The U of T(ears) Experience

I think during those times, I did regret coming to the University of Toronto, but
now that I am out of it, I am quite happy to have gone here. 
These 4 years were much harder than anything I've accomplished before, doing schoolwork almost 24/7 
and trying to keep up with all these courses, but I put a lot more into university than I did 
back in high school.


During my time at university, not only have I studied, but I have met lots of good people! 
I had lots of friends dating back from the CS POSt years, which was back when CS admissions was 
a bit of a free-for-all competition. They are one of the main reasons why I've gotten so 
far in my career, and why I have enjoyed university as a whole. This is even during COVID too!
We'd have Discord calls and do watch parties or game nights instead of our usual hangouts at 
school.


While I have never been able to attend the clubs that I wanted to during my undergrad, I 
was able to grow my career quite well, with the same friends I made helping me get my first 
software job (dApp) and being able to finish the best personal project I have worked on;
Zodiac Tail!


While some may say UofT (or in my case UTSC) is mostly doom and gloom, to me it was one of the
best times of my life so far!

## Course Recommendations

Here's a quick list of courses that have helped me advance as a software engineer:

* Theoretical Computer Science Courses (CSCC73H3, CSCC63H3, CSCB63H3, CSCB36H3, CSCA67H3) - I will probably never use such a higher level of math or correctness/optimization proofs ever again, but if there's this one thing that these set of courses taught me, is how to problem solve. Sure these courses come with interview questions that are wholly applicable to them, but they also allow you to stop and think about why these solutions work.
* Operating Systems (CSCC69H3) - I hate this course, and I still do. It was a course that felt like a full time job and it felt like I would never use it since I will never go into embedded software. However, I was wrong. Currently in Blackberry (and soon Trend Micro), we use an event-driven archtiecture which deals with a lot of queues, and for important endpoints that does a lot of things, they have rollback features to ensure that if one API call fails, the entire operation gets rolled back. Sounds familiar?
* Software Engineering Courses (CSC207H1) - 207 teaches the basics of writing OOP, which is still relevant since many companies use Java still. You'll see it more when interacting with most Java libraries.
* Courses specifically taught by Thierry Sans (CSCC09H3, CSCD27H3) - Usually has heavy emphasis on security and privacy, and was what propelled me into getting into the software cybersecurity field (that and CertiK lol)


## The Ceremony

It was nice to have the degree in hand. It's like, this paper, worth tens of thousands of my parents' dollars, and hours upon hours of studying, is in my hand. That's the only thing I could think of when I have this degree. When I got my High School diploma, it didn't feel like much because I never genuinely worked hard, except for that Computer Science Award. But this, even though hundreds of people have recieved something like this, it means much, much more.

My entire family was in attendance, and to celebrate we ate at this Filipino restaurant that I've never been to before!

It was good but I felt full very quickly :(

Anyways, that is all! Oh and I signed the Trend Micro offer, there's no turning back now!
