It was nice to have the degree in hand. It's like, this paper, worth tens of thousands of my parents' dollars, 
and hours of studying, is in my hand. That's the only thing I could think of when I have this degree.

My entire family was in attendance, and to celebrate we ate at this Filipino restaurant that I've never 
been to before!
