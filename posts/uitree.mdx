I have been working here for 10 months already, and so far things have been pretty interesting. 
Here at Trend Micro EMail Security (TMEMS), I got the chance to not only grow, 
but also make a pretty huge impact I'd say, so let's talk about it!

## uitree

This is just a small aside. At around May 2024, I made a service that mimicked Vercel's CI/CD easy UI deployment 
for each git branch, which is called the uitree! Currently, our UI system is a bit complicated to 
deploy, and it doesn't use Next.js so an existing system like Vercel wouldn't be feasible. It was an annoying 
problem since we could not deploy the UI locally. 


So using my self-hosting knowledge on Docker and NGINX reverse proxies, I basically just made something that allows 
multiple versions of these UIs to be run behind a reverse proxy, and have each of these UI instances be hosted under a 
subdomain! Pretty cool, right?


It basically means using a CI/CD pipeline which deploys and generates the URLs, you can have your UIs running on:
* 49dv9xjsla.uitree.tmems.com (your UI)
* 2938r03204.uitree.tmems.com (another developer's UI)
* jvfd9ppvoc.uitree.tmems.com (and another developer's UI)

and so on... and yes it's called uitree because of the network graph it produces.


Originally this started with a prototype with a bunch of "fake" frontends, and since my manager says I can 
dedicate time towards building this out for the UI of our product, Email Security, I was able to finish it!


I was able to present it to both the Canadian and Chinese teams for Email Security, and got some really good 
feedback to improve it from my coworkers! To this day when I have spare time, I try to implement new features 
or fixes to it. It's kind of, fun? or enjoyable? working on this project!
