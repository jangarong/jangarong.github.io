On Sunday, we went to our very first Michelin Star restaurant Enigma Yorkville!

* The salad was very good, and was surprisingly cheesy (not in a bad way at all though!).
* The tacos were the most expensive tacos I have ever had, but the mix of texture and the sauce was what made it so good too!
* The scallop was okay, but with the drink and the cucumber part made it a lot better!
* The hen with mushrooms was so good; itâ€™s like a mix of meatiness and sweet mushrooms which is a perfect combo in my eyes!
* The caviar was pretty good too, but the drink was very strong (as well as the starting kombucha).
* Lastly, there was this raspberry desert, but it was like a mix of candy and cakes and was not that sweet at all!

For our parting gift, we got a bag which included a brownie, oats and a menu of what we ate on that day!

Overall, a top 3 restaurant in my eyes!
