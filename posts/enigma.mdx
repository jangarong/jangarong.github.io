On Sunday, we went to our very first Michelin Star restaurant Enigma Yorkville.
We booked and prepaid in advance, which was roughly $300 CAD, and misread the time.
We thought it was at 1:30 PM but it was at 1:00 PM, which made us 20 minutes late,
and only realized this while we’re on Line 1.

When we got there, we were greeted by impeccable service despite being very late! There was someone who took our clothes and bags, someone who led us to our table, and the scenery is the best I’ve ever seen! There was even a waitress who offered services in both English and Mandarin :)) I will say though the clientele seems to be all international students while we were there lol

Once we were seated, we had the best eating experience ever!
The salad was full of flavour, and was surprisingly cheesy (not in a bad way at all though!).
The tacos were the most expensive tacos I have ever had, but the mix of texture and the sauce was what made it so good too!
The scallop was okay, but with the drink and the cucumber part made it a lot better!
The chicken with mushrooms was so good, the best meal ever (Mexi says otherwise though),
it’s like a mix of meatiness and sweet mushrooms which is a perfect combo in my eyes!
The caviar was pretty good too, but the drink was very strong (as well as the starting kombucha).
Lastly, there was this raspberry desert, but it was like a mix of candy and cakes and was not that sweet at all!

Did I mention the service was phenomenal? The waiters/chefs all gave us information on the food we were eating, changed our silverware for each course and everything! We felt like millionaires! And in the end? We got a gift bag which included a brownie, oats and a menu of what we ate on that day!

The bill ($600CAD) + tip ($50 CAD) was a bit unexpected though. I didn’t know adding caviar and drink pairings (and yes there is a non-alcoholic option) would double the price,
but it’s fine since it was all really good! I’d even say it’s worth every dollar, and for people doing the same thing shouldn’t treat it as just another restaurant,
but rather its own separate experience like rollercoasters, biking, seeing national parks. Your taste buds are in for an incredible ride!
