The game is almost done, minus a few assets, and a bunch of small coding tasks 
left to do.
The last major task left is the animations, which the artists are working hard 
on, and Leo is handling the programming for that right now. 

Currently Jay and I have been handling everything else. We're in charge with the rest of the sprite 
integration, she specialized in the UI/UX side of things, so main menu, 
pause screens, etc. and I was kind of everywhere, mainly integrating the
 visual novel.

While originally I knew it was going to take
  multiple days and it was going to be tedious, I didn't expect to run 
into as many bugs as I did while integrating. There's a lot of jank 
code now since we're running fast, and breaking things even faster, 
but I'm ok with that since our deadline is September 3rd.

I'm so excited to share the final product with everyone sooner or later! 
ZodiacTail is something that encompasses why I studied Computer Science. 
It isn't something that will make the most money, it isn't a FAANG/Unicorn 
internship or something that will lead to making millions of dollars, but it is fun to make, 
and fun to play too! 

Admittedly I'm way more proud of this game over 
past projects since it's a lot more polished, and a lot of very, very 
talented people have worked on this game! Amy and her team of cracked artists, 
and my other uni friends like Jay and Leo is partly what kept me 
doing 3AM all nighters, since everything from the code to the art has been made 
with a lot of talent and effort behind it! 

Either way, I'm tired and proud to be making this game!
