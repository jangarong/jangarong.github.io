Hello world! I will use this website to post the following:

## Website content
* Blog posts on engineering? cool locations? not sure.
* Contributions (will be on Side A)
* Creative Software i.e. Games
* Art (still not sure)
* Web Archive

That is all. I'll probably still continue remodelling this website.

Best,

Jan G.
