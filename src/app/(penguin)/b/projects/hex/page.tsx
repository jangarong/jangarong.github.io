               While I cannot share the application itself, it was a Python web application which 
               hosted a machine learning model which was based off of the surveys and research our team
               did. I was responsible for making the backend, which includes serving endpoints and 
               handling asynchronous events that may take a while (like testing the model on a set of data).
