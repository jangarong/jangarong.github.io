                This was for my Grade 11 Computer Science class (presented on Jan. 2018), where we all had to program in ActionScript (Flash).
                This was also a pretty huge milestone, since this was the first big coding project I had that
                required collaborating with other students. I have previously made games in GameMaker individually.
            </div><div className="mb-4">
                This is the same game, but only with the Boss Rush Mode tweaked to be playable for keyboard users. 
                Just as a fair warning, this game requires <b>heavy spamming</b> of the spacebar in order to progress.
                Also the music is <b>very loud</b>, sorry about that.
