# On the TODO list:
- cite https://portfolio-blog-starter.vercel.app for blog components
- add new project pages, maybe just small brief ones for the SaaS Security Products
- update homepage?
- add citation page with tech used
- why is `npm run make-win-x64` the only one that works?

docker save jangarong/jangarong.github.io:10.1.2 -o jangarong_img.tar

enforce `corp` mode to toggle not only the theta archives page but also the `corp` posts.
